Bootcamp Final Project

## Overview

An extrusion company creates a crosslinked blend of polypropylene and polyethylene using a water-activated catalyst. The cure process takes 10 days, and consists of taking moistened extrudate and placing it in an industrial oven for a period of 10 days. The degree of crosslinking is determined by evaluating the tensile strength and elongation of a material sample. QA acceptance criteria is based on the tensile and elongation results after the curing process.

The tensile and elongation results tend to have considerable variation. This analysis is to use supervised machine learning to identify contributing features, and identify high-risk scenarios for quality failures.

Some factors being examined include the processing equipment, conditions, and operators, the weather conditions for the cure period (the ovens are exposed to the environment), the month of production, and the test results prior to moisture curing.
